  "about": "I am an artist from South Korea inspired by the traditional Korean moon jar, which symbolizes simplicity and harmony. For me, it reflects the quiet strength and beauty of my culture.\n\nMy work often features bumpy textures that express a range of emotions—joy, sorrow, anger, love, and hope. I use acrylic paint, stone powder, modeling paste, and gel stone to build these surfaces.\n\nInspiration comes from prayer, gospel music, travel, and moments in daily life. I find comfort through art, especially during quiet nights, and hope my work offers that same comfort to others. I believe a life filled with dreams stays forever young.",
